## Details

### Roblox
I used **lua** to make the game, and I have been making the game for 1-5 months, the game is based on an **obby** where you do parkours to finish the game

You can get skips for every specific time, win bagdes, finish levels and enjoy

### Python
I used **Python** as the title, and the game is based on **guessing numbers**

You can buy coins, win coins, play and guess numbers

### Html Website
I used html only and it was kinda basic tbh, it is like a homepage showing you the pages of the pages you can access to

#### Pages:
**Games:** shows you the online games you can play

**Music:** Listen to some musics

**Help:** recieve some help

**Contact:** Contact to the support team

## Reason I made them
Well I am a tech obsession and it is my hobby so I made them for fun and learn more to do more advanced projects

## Time taken

Overall it took me over 1-5 months, it took 1 day to make the html website and the python game, and the roblox game took 1-5 months
